# Bank-Deposit-and-Withdrawal-App

A program that will simulate an online banking application. A
user will create an account with a fictitious bank. The account will include a savings account
and a checking account. Users will then be able to make deposits or withdrawals from either
account as long as the remaining balance is non negative.
